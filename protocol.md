## ÂµTP-based Data Transfer Protocol (UDTP)

### Introduction
The objectives of UDTP are:
- promote sharing of files
- shield a user from variations in file storage systems among hosts
- transfer data reliably and efficiently
- supports rendezvous connection setup and UDP-based hole punching techniques

UDTP is designed for use by programs. The attempt in this specification is to satisfy the diverse needs of peer-to-peer data transfer, with a simple, and easily implemented protocol design. This document assumes knowledge of TCP, UDP and P2P architectures.
