## udtp

µTP-based Data Transfer Protocol Node.js implementation.

udtp is implemented on top of [µTP](https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp) which provides a TCP-like implementation of [LEDBAT](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ledbat/charter/) documented as a BitTorrent extension in [BEP-29](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html). Therefore, udtp is mainly designed for peer-to-peer connections.
